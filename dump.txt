<p>HONG KONG An Andy Warhol portrait of former Chinese leader Chairman Mao Zedong has sold for $12.6 million at a Hong Kong auction, less than the $15 million it was expected to fetch.</p>
<p>The painting was sold to a private Asian collector at Sotheby's evening sale on Sunday.</p>
<p>Warhol began his series of silk-screen portraits of Mao in 1972 when ties between then Cold War foes China and the United States began to thaw after U.S. President Richard Nixon's historic trip to Beijing.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON A U.S. federal judge has allowed a lawsuit to proceed against Germany over claims of the Nazi-era theft from Jewish dealers of a celebrated collection of gilded medieval art treasures.</p>
<p>It was the first time a U.S. court had agreed to hear Nazi art theft claims against Germany, said Nicholas O'Donnell, an attorney for the heirs of three Jewish art dealers who say the Nazis terrorized their families in 1935 into selling the collection at far below market price.</p>
<p>The claim against Germany seeks the return of the Welfenschatz collection, which includes centuries-old gem-studded busts of saints and golden crucifixes.</p>
<p>Germany had asked for the case to be thrown out, arguing that a U.S. court did not have jurisdiction to deal with the matter.</p>
<p>Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ruled on Friday, however, in federal court in Washington that since the Nazis' organized plunder of Jewish property was part and parcel of their later genocide of the Jews - a crime under international law - the court had jurisdiction to hear the case.</p>
<p>Germany argued the case had already been heard before a German commission assessing Nazi-era property claims, which found the low sales price was a product of a collapse in the art market during the Great Depression - not because the Jewish art collectors were persecuted.</p>
<p>"This is a dispute that was already resolved on the merits in Germany, and it doesn't belong in a U.S. court," Germany's attorney, Jonathan Freiman, said in an email.</p>
<p>The Welfenschatz was collected for centuries by the Brunswick Cathedral in Brunswick, Germany, according to court records. In 1929, a group of Jewish art dealers in Germany bought the art from the Duke of Brunswick.</p>
<p>Six years later, the dealers sold the art to the state of Prussia, then being administered by prominent Nazi official Hermann Goering. Pressure from the Nazis caused the dealers to sell for just 35 percent of its market value, lawyers for the heirs said.</p>
<p>O'Donnell told Reuters in an interview that the money the dealers received was deposited into a bank account they were unable to access because it was blocked by the Nazis.</p>
<p>Much of that money was ultimately seized as "flight taxes" by the Nazis who forced Jews to pay exorbitant fees to be allowed to leave Germany.</p>
<p>O'Donnell said the transaction was orchestrated by Goering at the behest of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, who discussed in letters their effort to "save the Welfenschatz."</p>
<p>A few months after the sale was completed, Goering presented Hitler the Welfenschatz as a "surprise gift" during a ceremony, according to court records.</p>

<p>Artist James Rosenquist, a leading figure of the 1960s pop art movement known for his room-sized works, has died at the age of 83, his studio said.</p>
<p>Rosenquist helped define the genre of color-bursting displays of common objects that was also championed by the likes Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.</p>
<p>He died on Friday, the studio said, without providing further details.</p>
<p>Rosenquist had early experience as a billboard painter, which became a springboard for presentations of images that he culled from sources including print advertisements and magazines, it said.</p>
<p>He had shows in some of the world's most celebrated museums, including New York's Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain, it said.</p>
<p>"Painting is probably much more exciting than advertising," Rosenquist was quoted as saying by the Museum of Modern Art.</p>
<p>"So why shouldn't it be done with that power and gusto, with that impact."</p>
<p>One of his more celebrated works is "F-111,' which is billboard in size and made in 1964 and 1965, during the U.S. war in Vietnam. It combines images including a U.S. military warplane, a bombing and scenes of American prosperity, including a smiling blonde girl sitting under a hair dryer reminiscent of a missile, the museum said.</p>
<p>His celebrated 1962 painting of Marilyn Monroe was created shortly after her death and shows fragmented images of the global star that includes a segment of the Coca-Cola brand name, it said.</p>
<p>Rosenquist was born in Grand Forks, North Dakota where he had a nomadic life that took him and his parents to about a half dozen places including in Minnesota and Ohio. He studied at the University of Minnesota and moved to New York in his twenties.</p>
<p>"Painting has everything to do with memory. Images of the unexpected, the surreal, well up unbidden in your mind - as do things you haven't resolved," he said in his autobiography written with David Dalton titled "Painting Below Zero."</p>

<p>BERLIN A 1913 painting by Expressionist Ernst Ludwig Kirchner that was seized by the Nazis as "degenerate art" will remain in a Ludwigshafen museum after the German government and others paid 1.2 million euros to the heir of the painting's original owner.</p>
<p>"The Judgment of Paris," which shows three nude women and a clothed man posing in Kirchner's studio, was looted from Jewish art collector Hans Hess during the Nazi era, but has been on display at the Wilhelm-Hack Museum in Ludwigshafen since 1979.</p>
<p>Hess's heir agreed to allow the painting to stay on display at the museum after various donors, including the German federal and state governments and the Ernst von Siemens Foundation, raised money to compensate her, the German government said on Friday.</p>
<p>The agreement was made in accordance with the so-called Washington Declaration of 1998 that covers restitution of art confiscated by the Nazis before and during World War Two.</p>
<p>Culture state secretary Monika Gruetters described the purchase as "a great example of a public museum living up to its responsibilities for dealing with Nazi looted art."</p>
<p>Gruetters said the agreement was made possible by the generosity of the heir of the painting's original owner, and the extraordinary help of public and private donors.</p>
<p>The painting's title refers to the Greek myth about a contest between the three most beautiful goddesses of Olympus - Aphrodite, Hera and Athena - vying for the prize of a golden apple addressed "To the Fairest."</p>
<p>Decades after World War Two, German museums continue to address claims by those who had artwork stolen by the Nazi regime, although some museums are now facing lawsuits because they refused to surrender paintings.</p>

<p>Self-taught sculptor Emanuel Santos defended his grinning bust of Cristiano Ronaldo on Thursday, telling his thousands of online detractors he had followed the soccer star's instructions down to the last wrinkle.</p>
<p>Santos, a 40-year-old former airport cleaner, said the Real Madrid striker had asked him to make the portrait more jovial, and had praised his efforts.</p>
<p>"It's impossible to please the Greeks and the Trojans, and even Jesus couldn't please everyone ... It's a matter of taste and not as simple as it seems," Santos told Globo Esporte.</p>
<p>Officials unveiled the bronze bust at Madeira's airport on Wednesday, triggering an onslaught of online abuse and ridicule.</p>
<p>Some focused on the sculpture's toothy smile, others on its close-set, bulging eyes. All questioned the accuracy of its depiction of the Portugal captain, known for his model-like looks, who was there at the unveiling.</p>
<p>"Cristiano was one of the last people to arrive, but I spoke with him in the VIP room," Santos said after the unveiling. "I asked him what he thought of the result and he said he liked it."</p>
<p>Santos said Ronaldo had sent in suggestions while he was working on the sculpture.</p>
<p>"He only asked for some wrinkles that give him a certain expression to his face when he laughs to be changed," the Madeira native added. "He said it made him look older and asked for it to be thinned out a bit to make it smoother and more jovial."</p>
<p>The sculpture was unveiled to mark Madeira's decision to name its airport "Aeroporto Cristiano Ronaldo" after its hometown star.</p>
<p>Ronaldo, who scored his 71st international goal for Portugal in their 3-2 defeat by Sweden on Tuesday, helped the national side to their first international title when they defeated France in the European Championships final last summer.</p>

<p>PARIS French artist Abraham Poincheval, who famously spent two weeks inside a bear sculpture and a week inside a rock, began his latest feat on Wednesday - hatching eggs.</p>
<p>The 44-year-old, who specializes in performance art, will mimic a mother hen by incubating 10 eggs with his own body heat inside a glass vivarium until they hatch.</p>
<p>He reckons the endeavor will take from 21-26 days.</p>
<p>"I will, broadly speaking, become a chicken," Poincheval  said last month.</p>
<p>Poincheval says he seeks to explore varying concepts of time for different species and natural objects in his performances. The best way to understand objects is not from a distance but by entering them, he says.</p>
<p>In his latest experiment, Poincheval sits on a chair with the eggs in a container fixed under the seat.</p>
<p>He calculates that the heat from his body - kept high by him being wrapped in a thick, insulating blanket designed by Korean artist Seglui Lee - will maintain the right temperature directly over the eggs. He will eat certain foods such as ginger to raise his body temperature.</p>
<p>He will be able to stand up and leave his place over the eggs for no more than 30 minutes a day to receive meals that will be brought to him.</p>
<p>For his own calls of nature he will use a box beneath him, though he will not be able to get up to relieve himself.</p>
<p>This is the first time in his explorations that Poincheval confronts the world of the living.</p>
<p>Last month, he spent a week in a body-shaped slot carved out from a limestone rock in the same contemporary art museum in Paris, eating stewed fruit, soups and purees.</p>
<p>Before that, he had spent a fortnight living inside a hollowed-out bear sculpture in Paris's Museum of Hunting and Nature in April 2014, eating worms and beetles to mirror a bear's diet.</p>

<p>LONDON From Old Masters' self-portraits to contemporary selfies taken on phones, a London exhibition explores the creative potential of a mode of expression whose modern form is often derided as inane.</p>
<p>The British capital's Saatchi Gallery on Friday launches "From Selfie to Self-Expression", which it says will be the world's first exhibition looking at the history of selfies.</p>
<p>It kicks off with Rembrandt, the 17th century Dutch artist whose dozens of self-portraits created an intimate autobiography with confident brushstrokes. His paintings are represented on digital screens that one can "like", resulting in a red heart appearing over the image - just as on social media.</p>
<p>Modern-day selfies are different because they show "how we would like the world to see us, rather than how we are and who we are," said Saatchi Gallery Chief Executive Nigel Hurst.</p>
<p>"It's no coincidence... that most selfies are shot in pretty exotic locations, on holiday when people are experiencing things that are away from their humdrum, mundane lives," he told Reuters. "It's not about sharing our humanity, it's about really sharing a version of our identity that we would like people to believe."</p>
<p>In the digital age, the selfie has become ubiquitous, and the word was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2013.</p>
<p>Running to the end of May, the exhibition includes selfies by soccer player David Beckham and reality TV star Kim Kardashian, and even the first selfie shot by an animal (a monkey).</p>
<p>"People transform social media into something that is very expressive of being Chinese, or English, or Trinidadian and that is also true of the selfie," said University College London Professor Daniel Miller, who researched the phenomenon around the world.</p>
<p>"In southern Italy, people feel they almost have a responsibility to represent Italian stylishness. In Trinidad, you want to be highly individualistic."</p>
<p>The exhibition concludes with a critical stance on selfies, with an installation by Mexican artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer and Polish artist Krzysztof Wodiczko of 12 surveillance cameras.</p>
<p>"Selfies are not an option, it's something that is opening out our identity for good but mostly for bad, shaping up a controlling society," Lozano-Hemmer said.</p>
<p>"The problem is not that we don't have privacy any more."</p>

<p>BERLIN A Canadian gold coin named "Big Maple Leaf" which bears the image of Queen Elizabeth II was stolen in the early hours of Monday morning from Berlin's Bode Museum.</p>
<p>The coin is made out of pure gold, weighs about 100 kilos and has a face value of around $1 million.</p>
<p>"The coin was stolen last night, it's gone," museum spokesman Markus Farr said.</p>
<p>Given the high purity of the gold used in the coin, its material value is estimated to be $4 million.</p>
<p>The museum said on its website that the coin was issued by the Royal Canadian Mint in 2007 and that it was featured in the Guinness Book of Records for its "unmatched" degree of purity.</p>
<p>The coin, with a diameter of 53 centimeters and 3 centimeters thick, was loaned to the Bode Museum in December 2010.</p>
<p>Police said it was probably stolen by a group of thieves who entered the museum undetected through a window, possibly with the help of a ladder.</p>
<p>"Based on the information we have so far we believe that the thief, maybe thieves, broke open a window in the back of the museum next to the railway tracks," police spokesman Winfrid Wenzel said. "They then managed to enter the building and went to the coin exhibition.</p>
<p>"The coin was secured with bullet-proof glass inside the building. That much I can say," Wenzel added.</p>
<p>"Neither I nor the Bode Museum can go into detail regarding personnel inside the building, the alarm system or security installations."</p>
<p>The Bode Museum has one of the world's largest coin collections with more than 540,000 items.</p>

<p>AMSTERDAM Two paintings by Vincent Van Gogh were unveiled, barely damaged, at an Amsterdam museum on Tuesday, 14 years after they were stolen in a mafia heist.</p>
<p>The works, 1882's "View of the Sea at Scheveningen" and the 1884 "Congregation Leave the Reformed Church in Nuenen", are from a period that was crucial to the post-impressionist master's development as a painter.</p>
<p>"They are back," said Van Gogh museum director Axel Rueger ahead of the unveiling of the paintings, each valued by investigators on their recovery by Italian police six months ago at 50 million euros ($53.97 million).</p>
<p>"I never thought I'd be able to say these words."</p>
<p>The works were discovered deep in the heart of Italy last September behind a false wall in a villa that prosecutors said belonged to Raffaele Imperiale, who is accused of running an international cocaine trafficking ring.</p>
<p>The sea view, showing a single wave-tossed ship just offshore under a brooding Dutch sky, is important to the museum as its only work from the painter's period in The Hague, where he studied.</p>
<p>The other canvas depicts the church in the southern province  of Brabant where Van Gogh's father was minister. After his father died, Van Gogh added black-clad mourning figures to the painting in tribute.</p>
<p>"The children are safely returned now and they really are safe," said Rueger, after pulling back a screen to show the paintings encased behind a thick glass frame. "They will remain here for many generations to come."</p>
<p>Italian investigators believe Imperiale is living in Dubai and running a construction business there. The arrests of 11 members of his alleged ring last January, including one man who turned state's witness, led investigators to the paintings.</p>
<p>They vanished in 2002 after thieves climbed a ladder on to the museum roof and broke into the building in a heist that took only four minutes. They escaped by sliding down a rope.</p>
<p>The sea view suffered minor damage when it was ripped from its frame, losing a piece of backing paper from the bottom-left corner. It was a "miracle" the paintings suffered no further harm over the following 14 years, Rueger said.</p>
<p>Several major items were uncovered in last September's raid, including a private plane. One investigator noticed an unusual-looking wall, behind which the paintings were found wrapped in cloth.</p>
