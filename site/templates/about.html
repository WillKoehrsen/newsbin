					<p>
						newsbin pulls articles from hundreds of rss feeds provided by
						major news outlets, and fetches the articles into a single,
						combined stream. The feed is as up-to-date as it can be without
						spamming requests at the providers, which works out to about a
						10 minute delay.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can uses the tools in the left side to fetch the news
						that interests you- by source, category or keyword.
					</p>
					<p>
						While reading an article, you'll notice that some of the names
						and places are clickable. If you click on them, you'll get a
						brief summary of the topic without leaving the article.
						These are annotations.
						If you want to add more, just copy and
						paste a word or phrase (one that has an article on wikipedia)
						into the box at the top-left of the page and click 'Add'. Newsbin
						will fetch the information and it will be highlighted in every
						article from then on.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you see an annotation that's wrong, you can blacklist it
						for the current article by copying the text into the submission
						box and clicking 'Remove.'
					</p>
					<p>
						If you want to see what features are currently under development,
						you can take a look at open issues on github, and if you want
						to contribute, you can send me an email.
